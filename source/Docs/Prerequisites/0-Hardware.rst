Sensor Customization
********************

Rotor Encoder
=============

FRC teams often use the `CTRE CANCoder <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/cancoder/>`_
for measuring the angle of the rotor. It is a great sensor but it can be a bit expensive. 
Thus, teams with a tighter 
budget can consider using the `Thrifty Absolute Magnetic Encoder 
<https://www.thethriftybot.com/bearings/Thrifty-Absolute-Magnetic-Encoder-p421607500>`_. 
This encoder uses the same mount as normal CANCoders, but comes at a much cheaper price.

IMU
===

Additionally, teams must have an IMU on the robot to measure the angle of the robot. Popular 
IMU choices include the `Pigeon <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/pigeon-2/>`_ and 
`navX <https://www.andymark.com/products/navx2-mxp-robotics-navigation-sensor>`_ IMUs.

Conclusion
**********

As shown above, there are numerous ways to customize your swerve, 
all of which have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, it all comes 
down to how much time and money you are willing to spend on your swerve.
